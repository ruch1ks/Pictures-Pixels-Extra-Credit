# Pictures-Pixels-Extra-Credit
An application built using Java and Java Swing that allows users to modify a pre-loaded image in different ways. Users can change the brightness, saturation, and blurriness of the image, and can create a puzzle made up of pieces of the image. This was the extra credit project for my Foundations of Programming course.
